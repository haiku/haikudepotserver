<p>
    The repository is available for a number of different architectures.  Each
    of which is available as a discreet "repository source".  The repository
    source has a number of mirrors, one of which is nominated as the primary
    mirror and that is where the repository data will be obtained to refresh
    the records in HaikuDepotServer.

    Alongside the actual repository data, there is also a <code>repo.info</code>
    file with an <code>identifier</code> field.  This is a unique identifier for
    that actual repository source.  This <code>identifier</code> marries-up the
    HDS data with the repository configured in the client HaikuDepot desktop
    application.
