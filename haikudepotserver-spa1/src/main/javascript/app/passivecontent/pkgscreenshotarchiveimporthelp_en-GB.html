    This process will accept a tar archive file that has been gzip-compressed.  The typical
    file-extension for this archive format is "<code>.tgz</code>", but a file-extension of
    "<code>.tar.gz</code>" is also sometimes used.  The files in the archive should have the
    following nomenclature; &quot;<code>hscr/beshare/1.png</code>&quot;.  In this example, a PNG
    bitmap image is being supplied as a screenshot for the "beshare" package.  Any number of
    such screenshots can be supplied.

    The process can operate in one of two strategies.  In &quot;Replace existing screenshots&quot;
    mode, all existing screenshots are lost and the new screenshots are imported.  In
    &quot;Add to existing screenshots&quot; mode, existing screenshots are retained and new
    screenshots are imported in addition to those existing ones.
