<p>
    The repository is available for a number of different architectures.  Each
    of which is available as a discreet "repository source".  The repository
    source has a number of mirrors, one of which is nominated as the primary
    mirror and that is where the repository data will be obtained to refresh
    the records in HaikuDepotServer.

<p>
    Alongside the actual repository data, there is also a <code>repo.info</code>
    file with an <code>identifier</code> field.  This is a unique identifier for
    that actual repository source.  This <code>identifier</code> marries-up the
    HDS data with the repository configured in the client HaikuDepot desktop
    application.
