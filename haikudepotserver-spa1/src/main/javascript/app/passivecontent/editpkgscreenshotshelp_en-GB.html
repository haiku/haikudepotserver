<p>A few tips on creating screenshots:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can upload more than one screenshot and rearrange them later.</li>
    <li>Choose interesting situations of the application in action.</li>
    <li>Make the app's window as small as possible while still being aesthetically pleasing.</li>
    <li>
        Crop pixel-perfect with a transparent background (visible to the right of the yellow
        tab). Haiku's Screenshot app does that automatically for most kind of windows.
        WonderBrush works nicely for cropping and further editing.
    </li>
</ul>
