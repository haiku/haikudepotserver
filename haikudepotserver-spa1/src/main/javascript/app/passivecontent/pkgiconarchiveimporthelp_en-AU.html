<p>
    This process will accept a tar archive file that has been gzip-compressed.  The typical
    file-extension for this archive format is "<code>.tgz</code>", but a file-extension of
    "<code>.tar.gz</code>" is also sometimes used.  The files in the archive should have the
    following nomenclature; &quot;<code>hicn/beshare/icon.hvif</code>&quot;.  In this example, a HVIF
    vector icon is being suppplied for the "beshare" package.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes vector icon data is not available.  In this case a combination of 16, 32 and 64
    pixel-square PNG images may be supplied.  In this case, the following archive-entry
    nomenclature would be used; &quot;<code>hicon/beshare/16.px</code>&quot;.
</p>

<p>
    For each package that has icons modified by this process, previous icon data will be
    removed.
</p>

<p>
    The importing of a tar file of icons is &quot;atomic&quot; which means that it will either
    process the archive entirely or it will not modify the server-side data.  This is in
    relation to runtime errors such as invalid input data which prevent the process from
    running at all.
</p>

<p>
    Problems such as missing packages as well as the successful loading of an icon is reported
    back to the operator via a generated CSV file.
